<h1>My networking journey/knowledge</h1>

<p1>Hello, this is a place for my networking knowledge to go as I evolve, and for you to look and possibly learn too! <br> There is going to be lots of information, so be prepared! Lmao</p1>

<h2>Types of Networks.</h2>
<h3>Local Networks</h3>
<p1>Local networks come in all shapes and sizes. 
  They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices. <br> 
  Networks installed in small offices or homes are often referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks. <br>
  SOHO networks let you share resources and information, including files and videos, between a few local users in the general vicinity </p1>

<h3>Large Networks</h3>
<p1> Large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers or other districts. <br> 
  Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional means of communication, such as snail mail or long-distance phone calls. <br>
  Networks enable instant communication through email and instant messaging, and provide access to data and information stored on network servers or other devices. <br>
  Large (enterprise) and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet (connection of thousands of networks). <br> 
  The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is composed of hundreds of local networks that are interconnected, forming larger and larger networks (also known as the internet). <br>

<h2>Data Transmission</h2>

<h3>Types of data</h3>

<h4>Voluntered data</h4>
<p1>This type of data is the type you voluntarily give away, eg, uploading things to Google Drive, sending a text, etc. </p1>

<h4>Inferred data</h4>
<p1>This type of data you give away without realizing for instance, using your credit card, when a transaction happens, your credit card data is transferred to the store and your bank. <br>
  Your bank uses that data to gather information about you, your decisions, where you shop, etc. </p1>

<h4>Observed Data</h4>
<p1>This type of data is typically automatically collected by the device you use, for example, your location (if you have your location services turned on). <br>
  This data can be used by your cell phone provider to pinpoint where you are.</p1>
