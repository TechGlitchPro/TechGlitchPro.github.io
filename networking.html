<p1>Hello, this is a place for my networking knowledge to go as I evolve, and for you to look and possibly learn too! <br> There is going to be lots of information, so be prepared! Lmao</p1>

<h2>Types of Networks.</h2>
<h3>Local Networks</h3>
<p1>Local networks come in all shapes and sizes. 
  They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices. <br> 
  Networks installed in small offices or homes are often referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks. <br>
  SOHO networks let you share resources and information, including files and videos, between a few local users in the general vicinity </p1>

<h3>Large Networks</h3>
<p1> Large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers or other districts. <br> 
  Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional means of communication, such as snail mail or long-distance phone calls. <br>
  Networks enable instant communication through email and instant messaging, and provide access to data and information stored on network servers or other devices. <br>
  Large (enterprise) and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet (connection of thousands of networks). <br> 
  The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is composed of hundreds of local networks that are interconnected, forming larger and larger networks (also known as the internet). <br>
