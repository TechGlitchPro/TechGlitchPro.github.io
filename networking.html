<h2>Types of Networks.</h2>
<h3>Local Networks</h3>
<p1>Local networks come in all shapes and sizes. 
  They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices. <br> 
  Networks installed in small offices, or homes, are often referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks. <br>
  SOHO networks let you share resources and information including files, and videos between a few local users in the general vincinity</p1>

<h3>Large Networks</h3>
<p1>large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers or other districts. <br> 
  Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional means of communication, such as snail mail or long distance phone calls. <br>
  Networks allow for instant communication such as email and instant messaging, and provide access to data/information stored on network servers or other devices. <br>
  Large (enterprise) and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet (connection of thousands of networks). <br> 
  The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up hundreds of local networks that are connected to each other which can form larger and larger netwroks (aka the internet). <br>
